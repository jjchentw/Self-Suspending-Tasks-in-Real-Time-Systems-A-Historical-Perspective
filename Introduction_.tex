\section{Introduction}

In many real-time and embedded systems, tasks may be suspended by the operating system when accessing external devices such as disks, graphical processing units (GPUs), or synchronizing with other tasks. 
This behavior is often known as \emph{self-suspension}. Self-suspensions are even more pervasive in many emerging embedded cyber-physical systems in which the computation components frequently interact with external and physical devices~\cite{Kang:rtss07,kato2011rgem}. Typically, the resulting suspension delays range from a few microseconds (e.g., a write operation on a flash drive~\cite{Kang:rtss07}) to a few hundreds of milliseconds (e.g., offloading computation to GPUs~\cite{kato2011rgem,DBLP:conf/dac/LiuCTKD14}).
