\mychapter{Soft Real-Time Self-Suspending Task Systems}
\label{sec:soft-realtime}

For a hard real-time task, its deadline must be met; while for a soft real-time task, missing some deadlines can be tolerated. We have discussed the self-suspending tasks in hard real-time systems in the previous \mysectionrefnormal{}s. In this \mysectionrefnormal{}, we will review the existing results for scheduling soft real-time systems when the tasks can suspend themselves. So far, no concern has been raised regarding the correctness of the results discussed in this \mysectionrefnormal{}. 


 We assume a well-studied soft real-time notion, in which \emph{a soft real-time task is schedulable if its tardiness can be provably bounded} (\eg, several recent dissertations have focused on this topic~\cite{leontyev2010compositional, devi2006soft}). Such bounds would be expected to be reasonably small. A task's tardiness is defined as its maximum job tardiness, which is $0$ if the job finishes before its absolute deadline or is the job's completion time minus the job's absolute deadline otherwise. 
The schedulability analysis techniques on soft real-time self-suspending task systems can be categorized into two categories: suspension-oblivious analysis and suspension-aware analysis.

\mysection{Suspension-Oblivious Analysis}
\label{sec:sus-oblivious-soft}

According to \cite{Devi2005,Leontyev072}, an ordinary sporadic task system (\ie no self-suspensions) has bounded tardiness under global EDF for all the $n$ sporadic tasks if $\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i/T_i \leq M$, where $M$ is the number of processors in the system. The suspension-oblivious analysis simply treats the suspensions as computation, as also explained in Section~\ref{sec:model-interferred-oblivious} and Section~\ref{sec:model-interfering-oblivious}. Therefore, by suspension-oblivious analysis, an self-suspending sporadic task system  has bounded tardiness under global EDF for all the $n$ tasks if $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (C_i+S_i)/T_i \leq M$. This can be very pessimistic since $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (C_i+S_i)/T_i$ can easily exceed $M$ for schedulable task sets.

\mysection{Suspension-Aware Analysis}
\label{sec:sus-aware-soft}

Several recent work has been conducted to reduce the utilization loss by focusing on deriving suspension-aware analysis for soft real-time suspending task systems on multiprocessor systems, mainly done by Liu and Anderson~\cite{Liu3,Liu4,Liu5,Liu9,Liu11}. 
%The main idea behind these techniques is that treating all suspensions as computation is pessimistic. Instead, smartly treating a selective minimum set of suspensions as computation can significantly reduce the pessimism in the schedulability analysis. This is also the main reason why these techniques can significantly improve the suspension-oblivious approach in most cases.
In 2009, they derived the first suspension-aware schedulability test for soft real-time systems~\cite{Liu3} and showed that in preemptive sporadic systems bounded tardiness can be ensured under global EDF scheduling and global first-in-first-out (FIFO) scheduling. Their analysis uses a parameter $\xi_i$ ranging over $[0,1]$ to represent the \textit{suspension ratio} of task $\tau_i$, defined as $\xi_i = S_i/(S_i+C_i)$. The \emph{maximum suspension ratio} of the task set is $\xi_{max}=\max_{\tau_i} \xi_i$.
Specifically it is shown in \cite{Liu3} that tardiness in such a system is bounded if 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:constraint} U_{sum}^s + U_L^c < (1-\xi_{max}) \cdot M , \end{equation}
where $U_{sum}^s$ is the total utilization of all self-suspending tasks, $c$ is the number of computational tasks (which do not self-suspend), $M$ is the number of processors, and $U_L^c$ is the sum of the $\min(M-1,c)$ largest computational task utilizations.
% If $\xi_{max}$ is large, significant utilization loss may occur when using Eq.~(\ref{eq:constraint}). Unfortunately, it is unavoidable that many self-suspending task systems will have large $\xi_{max}$ values. 
%For example, consider an implicit-deadline soft real-time task system with three tasks scheduled on two processors: $\tau_1$ has $C_1=5, S_1=5$, and a $T_1=10$, $\tau_2$ has $C_2=2, S_2=0$, and $T_2=8$, and $\tau_3$ has $C_3=2, S_3=2$, and $T_3=8$. For this system, $U_{sum}^s = U_1+U_3= \dfrac{5}{10} + \dfrac{2}{8} = 0.75$, $U_L^c = U_2 = \dfrac{2}{8} = 0.25$, $\xi_{max} = \xi_1 = \dfrac{5}{5+5} = 0.5$. Although the total utilization of this task system is only half of the overall processor capacity, it is classified not schedulable using the prior analysis since it violates the utilization constraint in (\ref{eq:constraint}), \ie, since $U_{sum}^s+U_L^c =1=(1-\xi_{max}) \cdot M$.
In a follow-up work \cite{Liu5}, by observing that the utilization loss seen in (\ref{eq:constraint}) is mainly caused by a large value of $\xi_{max}$, a technique was presented to effectively decrease the value of this parameter for improving the analysis. 
% They show that this can be done by treating \textit{partial} suspensions as computation. That is, they consider intermediate choices between the two currently-available extremes of treating \textit{all} (as is commonly done) or \textit{no} (using the analysis in ???Liu093) suspensions as computation. 
% This approach is often able to decrease $\xi_{max}$ at the cost of at most a slight increase in the left side of (\ref{eq:constraint}). 
% The authors present both a linear programming solution for determining how much suspension time to be treated as computation as well as an optimal algorithm that runs in $O((N^s)^2)$ time, where $N^s$ is the number of self-suspending tasks. The authors analyze the schedulability improvement brought by the proposed approach via an experimental study involving randomly-generated task systems. In all scenarios considered in this study, this approach was able to improve schedulability, and in most scenarios, by a substantial margin. 
% In \cite{Liu4}, Liu and Anderson  showed that any task system with self-suspensions, pipelines, and
% non-preemptive sections can be transformed for analysis purposes into a system with only self-suspensions \cite{Liu4}. The transformation process treats delays caused by pipeline-based precedence constraints and non-preemptivity as self-suspension delays.
% In \cite{Liu9,Liu11}, Liu and Anderson derived the first soft real-time schedulability test for suspending task systems that analytically dominates the suspension-oblivious approach.
 % Specifically, they show that an $O(M)$ utilization loss (where $M$ is the number of processors) can be achieved under a new suspension-aware analysis technique.
